# Overview: Rust Manager

This program is to demonstrate my current knowledge of the Rust language as part of building up an online software portfolio.

The program, **p_manager** enables users to create usernames and passwords in a password manager. These are stored through structures and Vecs, which enable setting and retrieving of accounts and passwords.

My purpose in writing this program is to show my current knowledge of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, data structures(vec), and object oriented techniques(struct, impl) within the Rust language.

# Development Environment

This program uses Rust as its programming language. To use Rust, you are required to install **rustup**, and the Rust Analyzer on Visual Studio Code.

This Rust language program uses the **std::io** to read user input and flush the output. It also uses **std::collections::Vec** to create and use Vecs.
