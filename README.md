# Development Environment

This program uses Rust as its programming language. To use Rust, you are required to install **rustup**, and the Rust Analyzer on Visual Studio Code.

This Rust language program uses the **std::io** to read user input and flush the output. It also uses **std::collections::Vec** to create and use Vecs.
